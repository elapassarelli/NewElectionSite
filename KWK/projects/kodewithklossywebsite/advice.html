        <p>If you are attending the Los Angeles program, our first piece of
        advice to you is to GET EXCITED! This will definitely be the highlight
        of your summer.  Should you find yourself feeling a little nervous,
        don't worry! You are in great hands with the wonderful teachers Jeff
        and Taylor, along with the TAs, who will make you feel completely
        at home! There are plenty of chances to get to know each other
        throughout the days, and the environment is completely supportive of every student,
        whether you're coming in with experience or none at all!<br /><br />

        If you're worried about meeting new people, push yourself a little
        out of your comfort zone! If everyone in the groupchat is going
        for coffee, go for coffee! It's a great opportunity to get to know
        the girls you are going to be with for the next two-weeks, and they
        will likely become life-long friends.<br /><br />

        If no one has initiated anything, the other girls are probably just as worried as you!
        See if everyone wants to hang out outside of class, it couldn't hurt!
        <br/><br />
        For day to day, the best thing you can do is make sure you get a
        a good night's sleep and eat a good breakfast so that you are feeling
        your best throughout the day! And get excited or lunch, because the food
        is seriously SO good!</p>
