pwd - print working directory (where the console is working)
touch _____ - created a file
mkdir _____ - creates a directory (folder), if you have a space between a folder it will make two different folders
mv ____ (file) ____(foldername)/ - moves a file into folder
clear - clears everything
ls- (we are in the ___ folder, the working directory)- show me everything that is in the ___ folder
tab will auto complete something for you
cd ___ (folder)/ - changes the working directory
cd .. - moves the working directory up one level
mv ____ (file) _____ (new name for that file) - will change the name of that file
rmdir ____ (folder/directory) - will remove a directory
rm ____ (file) - will remove a file
mkdir Folder1/Folder2/Folder3/NameOfNewDirectoryFolder - will put the new directory into a bunch of other folders
cd ~ - brings you one level out of your main folder so you don't have to go up a bunch of times
      ^^ OR cd ../../.. (etc) - will bring you out of a bunch of folders, the amount of the dot dots
rm -rf ___ (directory name) -- this will delete a directory with stuff inside it
puts - like system.out.println in java
.# - this is a comment (not the dot just the number sign)
* number - this will do something that many times
variables just put ____(name) = "variable info"
interpolation - a better way to concatenate variables, just do a string like this " and add #{variable} inside"
doubles like in java are called FLOATS in ruby, basically the same thing just add a .0 or decimal to an integer, again if one of them is a float, the whole outcome will be a float
gets.chomp : basically do a variable = gets.chomp to get user keyboard input

parameter- the in parenthesis thing that is in a method
arguments- specific versions of parameters
if you want to have a parameterized method and a non-parameterized method, write it like this; method(parameter="default")
